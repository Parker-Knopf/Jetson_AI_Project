# Object Password Prototype 
Jetson AI Specialist Project


In todays modern world, passwords are becoming more and more vunerable. A way this can be solved is to hide the password in a nuerual-net. One cannot uncover the password simply by looking at the nueuro-net, since it is too complicated. You must have the object the neuro-net is trained for. There are millions of objects in the world making each password entiely unique to the user. Using common objects as elements of a password would be very secure since you would first need to know what objects are valid elements and what order they go in.
